	<h1>Hello Everyone</h1>
	<h2> Im Supriya came in front of you all</h2>
	<h3>Today my topic is <b>Is arrange marriage better than love marriage</b></h3>
	<p>Now today in 20's era everyone move towards high societies,parties,luxuries life style but the <b>mentality</b>is same like 80's or 90's.We were taught right from our childhood that every citizen have their own rights like right to speak,right to take their own decision etc but when it come to the relationship status everyone backout,while every one have right to choose their partners.<em>Why not
	family understand that he or she was going to live with him or her</em>.<i>Everyone know we can't judge a book by its cover</i>. So how can we choose our life partner in just one meeting.I think love marriage is best as we can atleast know that person's behaviour,nature,likes,dislikes many more.
	I know parents have a point that in this era divorces are common because of love marriage,<b>actually no,divorces are common because today women are also independent</b> now women are not dependent on their husband for their survival.They can handle herself independently.
	SO these are my opinion towards love marriage <b>what about you ?</b>
